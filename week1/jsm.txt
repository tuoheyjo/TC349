Week 1 - Website Critique

Jason Santa Maria's website is very well laid out and organized. All of his information is easily accessible and 
the site for the most part feels clean. A few minor tweaks could improve upon the site. Ultimately though, 
it is usable, good-looking and solid design. 

I like the site overall. The color scheme is attractive and does a good job of providing contrast. The tabs make
information more easily accessible and easy-to-use than some other sites I've seen. The thumbnails (and/or previews)
on the right side of posts add some variety and fun to the main page. On the various pages, the links for filters
are clever and make finding specific articles easier. This is an excellent personal website. 

The only improvements I would make would be to include less information that is always at the bottom of the page, 
and to finish up the "Portfolio" tab. At the bottom of every page is the small heading, "On the subject of me" which
seems a little self-centered. More importanly, it clutters all of the pages with information that would be better
suited to its own tab. And this may be obvious, but it was disappointing to see that the portfolio tab was still 
under construction.
