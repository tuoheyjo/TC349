Week 1 - Environment Selection

The environment I chose for development is a combination of Chrome, Notepad++ and of course the Git Bash Shell.
I chose this set up because I have a two monitor set-up at home, running Windows 7. Chrome was actually my 
default browser because I like its design which is lightweight and streamlined. When installing Git on my computer, 
simply using the default Git Bash Shell seemed like the best option instead of the Windows terminal because 
I'm actually the most comfortable with Bash commands.

Notepad++ seemed to be highly regarded and I liked its ability to recognize keywords as well as having tabs instead
of having many windows open. Ultimately, the result of the three programs (and two screens) will let me keep up
with online lectures as well as do development with minimal switching between windows.
