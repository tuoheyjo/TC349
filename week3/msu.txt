Week 3 - MSU Website Critique

Overall, I like MSU's homepage. It feels modern without being overbearing, while making 
important information easily accessible. The fonts are large and easy to read, 
and the various colors break up the website to make it visually appealing. The drop 
down menus in off-white are extremely useful for finding information, and the search
function is large and easy to read, unlike many homepages. Generally, it is a 
useful, good-looking website.

There are a few minor gripes I do have about the page, though. The smaller headings 
for Students, Faculty & Staff, etc. feel jammed into the page and make it a little
more clunky. While the MSU Talk feature at the bottom of the page is a nice feature,
the extra two graphics for Spartan Sagas and the "One Book, One Community" campaign 
make the site messier. These are, however, minor gripes in the grand scheme of things.
