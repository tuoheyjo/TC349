Week 8 Critique - Happy Cog

	The Happy Cog Website is well laid-out and very unique. I really 
enjoy the fact that everything is encapsulated on the homepage and
can be navigated to using the navigation bar, but also found organically
by using simply scrolling. The colors are bright without being annoying,
and the content itself was also interesting. 
	The only thing I would change about the site would be to delineate
the sections a bit more clearly. As I was scrolling down the main page, 
it was sometimes difficult to figure out exactly where a section began 
or ended without clicking on the navigation pane. This would be easily 
fixed and is a relatively minor complaint in the grand scheme of things.
