	<h4>Panic.com Critique</h4>
	<p>The Panic website is very well put together and has some nice features, but could be 
	improved a bit. The icons representing the various software products that Panic makes 
	are attractive and useful for a person unfamiliar with the company. I like the features 
	at the bottom of the page as well which make communicating with the company easy and fast. 
	The visible area when the page initially loads seems intentional and shows Panic's most 
	important information. The product pages are well laid-out and helpful. 
	</p>
	<p>On the other side of the coin, there are a few changes to the website that I'd make. 
	First, there's a lot of wasted, empty space in the upper left and upper right portions of 
	the page that could be used for something. Second, having a site map would be pretty nice, 
	just to make finding specific information easier. Finally, I would leave the background 
	white instead of the gray currently used. However, the site is generally excellent.
