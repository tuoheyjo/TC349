Week 10 Writing - MSU Mobile

	The MSU Mobile website is not very impressive on its face, with an exceedingly simple 
dashboard of available options. However, these available options are very good ones, and
make the entirety of the MSU Mobile site pretty good. The main dashboard has just 8 options
(not including the Full Site link or the customize option) give the impression that the 
mobile site is not well fleshed out. 
	But the individual features - People, News, Events, Map, Athletics, About MSU, Libraries, 
and Video are all pretty good representations of their browser counterparts. The people 
search does exactly what it does on the browser version, while News and Events give
as much information as possible considering the cramped screen size. The Map
site is well thought out and lets you look up a specific building on campus, which would be
really helpful when walking around and lost. Similarly, the libraries site gives hours and 
locations first, which would be the most important things for somebody accessing from a
mobile device. All in all, though the number of features is somewhat limited, the ones
that are available are high quality.
