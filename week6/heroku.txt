Week 6 Critique

	The Heroku website is clean, attractive, and interactive in a fun way. I like the 
way that portions of the site light up when they're hovered over, and that on the first page that
is shown on the site, it is possible to get to any important information. The 'How it Works' page
is particularly interesting, with a complicated interactive model on the page. And while that
model is complicated, the interactivity of the model made me interested in poking around and 
learning more about what they do. The 'Pricing' section is similarly interactive and interesting,
with large sliding scales and dynamic information.
	My biggest problem with the Heroku site is the color scheme. On the bottom of each page, the
navigation font is just varely lighter than the background color. It helps that when the links 
are hovered over, the navigation links lighten. But in general, the color scheme is dark and I
would have chosen a lighter font for these links as well as some of the text on each individual
page. 

	For my layouts of my personal site, I decided to use a single-column format. Most of my content
is short enough to include a picture and the navigation in the footer on the very first length of 
screen, and it is most attractive in a single-column format. Changing the way my content was 
structured was a helpful exercise though, as before now, the layout was somewhat clunky.
