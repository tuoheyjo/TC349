Mobile Website Critique

	The mobile website I use often is Tumblr. This is due to the fact that I do not 
have a Tumblr account myself, but I do enjoy checking a few choice accounts fairly
often. The Tumblr mobile website is quite nice to use, and does a good job of 
emulating the experience from the usual desktop website. All of the information is 
scaled nicely to the smaller screen, with very little loss.
	The biggest element of Tumblr that is lost on the mobile device is the unique
background for individual users. This is not a particularly huge deal because those 
backgrounds are not dynamic content, nor do they change much from user to user. 
However, the mobile site scales and centers content nicely, allows users to look at
notes on posts, and allows for loading more posts than just the first page. Overall,
it is a very usable and attractive mobile site.
