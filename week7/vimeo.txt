Week 7 Critique - Vimeo

	The Vimeo website is quite well put together and is attractive. The
pages are put together nicely and none of the information displayed, either
on specific "channels" or on Vimeo information pages, seems extraneous or
unnecessary. The navigation bar on the bottom is useful and makes the site
easy to explore from any page.
	Further, I like the way that Vimeo uses a combination of different layouts.
Many pages are a simply one-column design, but for specific channels, a 
layour similar to a gallery is used, and this design makes the information much
easier to see and interact with. The "channel" architecture is familiar due to 
the same nomenclature being used on YouTube. The only thing I would change 
about the Vimeo site is how often the site asks me to join it. I understand
that they need to prompt users to join, but it would be preferable to not
be asked so may times.
