	<h1>Welcome to Joe Tuohey's TC 349 Week 5 Assignment - PART 2</h1>
	<section class="content">
		<p>The design I'd like to tackle for my final project is a website for a Big Ten only
			fantasy football league I manage for myself and five friends. Currently we manage
			it through Facebook and Google Documents, but it would be nice to have a site for 
			ease of accessibility.</p>	
		<table border="1">
			<tr>
				<td><p>Rosters<a href="img/rosters.jpg"><img src="img/rosters.jpg" height="200" width="200"/></p></td>
				<td><p>Stats Leaders<a href="img/statsLeaders.jpg"><img src="img/statsLeaders.jpg" height="200" width="200"/></p></td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td><p>Draft Results<a href="img/draftResults.jpg"><img src="img/draftResults.jpg" height="200" width="200"/></p></td>
				<td><p>Schedules<a href="img/schedules.jpg"><img src="img/schedules.jpg" height="200" width="200"/></p></td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td><p>League Info<a href="img/leagueInfo.jpg"><img src="img/leagueInfo.jpg" height="200" width="200"/></p></td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		<p>The design here was pretty straightforward because there simply isn't that much
				information to hold on the site. I had the cards reviewed by my friends who 
				participate in this league with me, and they had essentially the same design.</p>
