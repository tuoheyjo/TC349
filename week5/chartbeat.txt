Week 5 Critique
	
Chartbeat is an attractive website and appears largely easy to use. The 
logos are large, the information is easy to see, and in general good-looking.

One change I'd make to this site is that the bar at the top scrolls down with
the page and is large and blocks out information from being displayed, which
is annoying and not useful.
