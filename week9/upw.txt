Week 9 Writing - United Pixelworkers

	United Pixelworkers is a well-designed website but it was pretty difficult to figure out
exactly what the website was about at first. I like the simplicity of the site, with its 
gallery layout that is easy to navigate, and the attractive colors. The amount of merchandise
they have on the site is impressive and well put together.
	The only problem with the site is that I had to dig a bit in order to actually find what
the website was all about. At first I thought the site was a job postings site, which is, in
fact, one new function of the site. But I had to go to the "About" page, and read the entire 
description, in order to determine that it was a site dedicated to merchandise.
